    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">What's Vindinium?</h1>
    <p style="color:white">Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. This also have you 'take control' of a legendary hero, who are actually called "bots",using the programming language of your choice. And when your bot enter the arena, it will fight against other AI and start a compettion that will last for a predetermined amount of turns to see who will have the most amount of gold. Think you will have the most amount of gold? Lets find out.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">How To Play Vindinium</h1>
    <p style="color:white">I briefly explained how this work but let's go more into detail. First off, the goal for the Vindinium game is to see how much gold a bot with AI, that you make yourself, can have within a certain amount of turns, and in most cases each match would last 1200 turns. Turns are taking when a bot take a step and each time a bot collect gold(s). And that brings us to the gameplay of Vindinium. So, as told before, the goal of the game is to the most gold when the round is over and to obtain such gold(s) your need collect mines guarded by trolls. Along the way, your bot will most likely fight other bots for their mines, as well as go to taverns to heal themselves. To fully understand, lets go into detail with each important part of the vindinium game, starting with the most important part of the game, the bots.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">The Bots</h1>
    <p style="color:white">This is gonna be a bit complicated so bear with me. Also, keep in mind that you won't control your bot manual, and that will be explained in a bit. Now, the bots goal in the game is to take mines, guarded by trolls, all while healing themselves with taverns and fighting against other bots. But for your bot to even move, you need the right type of codes, like these:</p>
    <img id="imgsrc"  src="https://codio.com/jorgec/W8-Project/tree/Screenshot%202015-06-10%20at%2010.01.49%20AM.png">
    <p style="color:white">To summarize what these code do as a whole. Basically, these codes will make bot decide what it should do in different situation. For me, when my bot hp(heart points) is less than or equal to 40, it will go to the nearest tavern(s) to heal, and if possibly collect some mines along the way. But if my bot doesn't need to go to the nearest tavern it will start to mine gold that are either not owned by anyone or take some other bot(s) mine(s). Now let's talk about the mines.</p>
    <h1 style="color:white; text-align:center">Mines</h1>
    <p style="color:white">These are where your bot will got there gold(s), however they are by trolls. If you want to get a mine to get gold(s), your bot will need to attack the troll which will take a 1/8 of health to do so. After you've acquire a mine you will recieve a piece gold every turn, and the more mines you have the more gold you'll recieve in one turn. For example, if you have 6 mines you will recieve six pieces in one turn and so on. Also, when your bot take a mine, the top of the mine will change color that will correspond to your bot color. Now, I did mention that your bot loses some of it hp to a troll that was guarding the mine your bot took, what I didn't mention is that your bot actually loses 1 hp per turn due to dehydration so you lose hp either. So where does your bot heal? The taverns ... let's talk about those.</p>
    <h1 style="color:white; text-align:center">Taverns</h1>
    <p style="color:white">These are basically the hospital for your bot and restore their hp, even though they have the appearence of those cups that you ut beer in. However, your bot won't go to the tavern unless you out some kind of code that activate a command. For me, when the bot hp is equal to or less than 40 it will try find the closet tavern it can get to heal. Now as simple as that may be, your bot will need to understand the layout of each map...which reminds me.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">Vindinium Maps</h1>
    <p style="color:white">Note: Every round will have a randomely generated map so some map will be different while others are some you meant remember. But even if they are randomly generated they do have some important element for each round. Those being: the spawn place for your bot to appeared when the round starts or when your bot hp reaches zero, the mines, and the taverns.</p>
