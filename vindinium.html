    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">What's Vindinium?</h1>
    <p style="color:white">Vindinium is an Artificial Intelligence programming challenge. This also have you 'take control' of a legendary hero, who are actually called "bots",using the programming language of your choice. And when your bot enter the arena, it will fight against other AI and start a compettion that will last for a predetermined amount of turns to see who will have the most amount of gold. Think you will have the most amount of gold? Lets find out.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">How To Play Vindinium</h1>
    <p stlye="color:white">I briefly explained how this work but let's go more into detail. First off, the goal for the Vindinium game is to see how much gold a bot with AI, that you make yourself, can have within a certain amount of turns, and in most cases each match would last 1200 turns. Turns are taking when a bot take a step and each time a bot collect gold. </p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white">The Bots</h1>
    <p style="color:white">This is gonna be a bit complicated so bear with me. Also, keep in mind that you won't control your bot manual, and that will be explained in a bit.</p>
